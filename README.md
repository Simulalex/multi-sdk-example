# multi-sdk-example
An example of using Swagger Codegen to generate SDK in multiple languages. This is (well, will be) part of a blog post describing how to generate and consume SDKs in multiple languages from an OpenAPI spec.

## How to run this:
### Java
`./gradlew clean buildJavaClient build`

### Ruby
`bundle install`
`bundle exec rspec`
